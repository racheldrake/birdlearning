## Effects of Merlin on the eBird dataset

Scripts are labelled in sequential order and data is uploaded to run the three analysis scripts. 
Data for previous scripts should be downloaded centrally from eBird. Supplementary data (BBS and the Macaulay Library audio index) is included.

Code is formatted such that all variables that need changed are at the top of the script, I don't recommend changing any of this because I'm not 100% certain
that the folder tagging is the same throughout though I've tried to comment them as helpfully as possible.

Analyses are completed by Rachel Drake, with supervision from Alison Johnston and David Borchers.
